## Example PHP MVC Application


### Description:

Based on the [PHP Academy MVC Application Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfdtiltiRHWGXVHXX09fxXDi-DqInchFD), this is my first look at an MVC framework in PHP. This is a very basic example and does well to introduce the user to a Model-View-Controller architecture (Currently the rage with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)).

I am a self-taught developer, and owe my understanding of OOP to [Stanford's Programming Methodoloy Open Coursware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMDCCdjyW8) I took 2 years ago. The concept of inheritance and objects was refreshing as I have done little OOP till recently.

I made this example in preparation for building a PHP MVC application using the [Phalcon PHP Framework](http://www.phalconphp.com/en/).
